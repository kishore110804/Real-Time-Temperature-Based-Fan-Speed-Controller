GENERATED GRAPHS FOR REPORT/PRESENTATION:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Period vs Time (Jitter & Deadline Misses)
   File: 1_period_vs_time_jitter.png
   Description:
   Shows real-time task execution period with jitter analysis.
   Highlights deadline violations and acceptable jitter bounds.
   Key for demonstrating real-time system performance.

2. Temperature & PWM vs Time (Step/Ramp Tests)
   File: 2_temp_pwm_vs_time.png
   Description:
   Dual-axis plot showing temperature changes and PWM response.
   Demonstrates proportional control algorithm in action.
   Shows different test phases: ramp-up, steady-state, peak operation.

3. PWM vs Temperature Scatter with R² Correlation
   File: 3_pwm_vs_temp_scatter_r2.png
   Description:
   Scatter plot with linear regression showing control linearity.
   R² value demonstrates excellent proportional relationship.
   Includes confidence interval and ideal line comparison.

4. CPU Utilization Bar Chart
   File: 4_cpu_utilization_bar.png
   Description:
   Compares CPU usage across different operating scenarios.
   Baseline (25°C) vs Heated Step vs Peak Load (100°C).
   Demonstrates system efficiency and real-time capability.

5. Fault Event Timeline & Recovery
   File: 5_fault_event_timeline.png
   Description:
   Timeline showing fault events, severity, and recovery times.
   Demonstrates system reliability and error handling.
   Includes uptime percentage and Mean Time To Recovery (MTTR).

HOW TO USE THESE GRAPHS:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

FOR REPORT:
1. Insert graphs in appropriate sections (Results, Analysis, etc.)
2. Reference R² value from Graph 3 when discussing control accuracy
3. Use CPU utilization (Graph 4) in Performance Analysis section
4. Include fault timeline (Graph 5) in Reliability/Testing section

FOR PRESENTATION (PPT):
1. Use Graph 3 (R² scatter) as your key result slide
2. Graph 2 (Temp/PWM vs Time) shows dynamic response clearly
3. Graph 4 (CPU bar chart) demonstrates efficiency visually
4. Graph 1 shows real-time performance (jitter analysis)
5. Graph 5 demonstrates robust error handling

TECHNICAL NOTES:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• All graphs generated at 300 DPI (high resolution for print)
• PNG format (suitable for Word, PowerPoint, LaTeX)
• Color-coded for clarity and professional appearance
• Statistical annotations included where relevant
• Legends and labels clearly visible
